# Steam Helper
Helpers files that I made mainly for myself that can help you get information about your Steam library.

### steam.py
When running this file, you will get, as output, a list of the Steam games that are installed on your machine.

### nonsteam.py
When running this file, you will get, as output, a list of the Non-Steam games that you added to your Steam library.

### grid.py
When running this file, it will search Steam Grid DB for grid images for your Non-Steam games and download them to your Steam's grid folder and rename then accordingly.
